Welcome on **0x0** project home page.

This project contains some selfhosted (by Me) services which are free to use for everyone. You can check them on [Services page](/services).

Registration is mostly open but there are few services like Gitea or Miniflux which has closed registration. If you want account on them, just send me an email. You must read **[Terms of service](/tos)** before.

**You will need PGP key because I will not send you password over internet as plain text**

## Abuse

Send me an email: `email=$(printf 'may%smaymeow%scom' @ .) | echo $email`.

Allow up to 48 hours to response.
